        <p>Though the name 'Sandesh' may be common for others but it's unique for me
        bacause it actually describes who I'm.</p> <!-- <p> seperate the text in paragraph -->
        <p>I is a normal guy with introverted personality.I was born on 3rd december 1997
        in chitwan district of Nepal.I was grown up in a family of 4. My parents has always
        supported me in my studies in every way they can. Although, there were times when my
        parents were facing difficulties but they never let it affect in my studies. I was send
        to good school, good college, and provided quality education. I completed my school and
        High school in my hometown(Chitwan) and brought to KTM after, for further studies.</p>

        <p>Actually to say, I never had a goal in my life. I didn't know what to do in my life. I was
        only following my parents instincts regarding my education. So I ended up preparing myself
        for IOE Entrance exam. while preparing for the exam, I didn't really enjoy it. so I was
        worried where my life his ends. After taking exam, I had consultation with one of my teacher
        regarding my future plan. Then he introduce me to IT ; its present status, background,
        and its importance in comming future. After knowing about it, I find it intresting and now
        I ended up in NAMI(<a href="http://www.northampton.ac.uk">Unversity of Northampton</a>).</p>
        <p>And I hope my journey to IT field in NAMI college would be intresting, fun and memorable.</p>
